Enhanced Analysis of Calgary, Canada's Crime Database \
The dataset is from City of Calgaryâ€™s Open Data Portal ([Dataset](https://data.calgary.ca/Health-and-Safety/Community-Crime-Statistics/78gh-n26t/about_data))

The following code presents an in-depth analysis of Calgary crimes spanning from 2018 to 2023. I will utilize Python for data analysis, wrangling, and visualization. Additionally, I will attach a Power BI file containing more detailed visualizations.
